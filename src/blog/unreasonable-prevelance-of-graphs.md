As you have likely heard from many places before, graphs are all around us.  Graphs as in the mathematics/computer science-y kind, the ones with nodes and edges.

Tons of things in the world around us take their primary form as graphs to be sure, but it goes much deeper than that.  I've found graphs to be fundamental to the nature of basically everything: information, thought, space, time, and reality itself boil down to graphs at their lowest most essential levels.

This is something I've spent a good deal of time thinking about over the years, and I'm certainly not alone.  As I'll detail later on, there are many different approaches that use graphs as the basis for axiomatic representations and understandings of a huge number of fields and areas of research.  Many of them take a very mathematical and formal approach,but I feel that the core part of this idea can be understood just by making observations and simple conclusions based off of them.

## Graphs from the Bottom Up

At its most basic level, a graph consists of things/entities (nodes) and relationships to other things (edges).  That's all there is to it.  Any kind of information or meaning requires some kind of relationship or interaction between *things* in order to exist.

Integers exist solely within the context of numbers that come before and after them.  Even the number 0 can only be understood within the context of something non-zero existing - a relationship (edge) between existince and non-existence.  The empty set implies and necessitates the existence of a non-empty set in order for the word "set" to mean anything whatsoever.

Giving something properties, attributes, or descriptions immediately brings a torrent of graph relationships into existence including the relationships:

 * Between the thing and the descriptor and vice versa
 * Between the descriptor and all other descriptors describing the thing
 * Between the thing and all other things described by the descriptor

It's a combinatorial explosion of relationships.  Edges can take the place of nodes and vice versa.  Higher-level graph features such as clusters and other patterns form nodes are related to each other to create more graphs and meta-patterns up and up and up.  Everything is somehow linked to everything else through the shared property of existence.

Before devolving too far into recursive nonsense, this section can be summed up as **information itself is inherently built out of graphs; knowledge exists as relationships between things**.

### Graph Embeddings

One of my favorite books of all time is [Diasopra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(novel)) by Greg Egan.  It's a captivating and inspiring decription of a trans-humanist universe that feels like the closest thing I've ever witnessed to a glimpse into the distant future.

One thing it describes is the ["Truth Mines"](https://everything2.com/title/Truth+Mines) - a virtual spatial representation of all of humanity's combined knowledge created by starting with axioms and connecting proofs, stretching out to infinity.  Although it's mathematically tilted (Greg Egan himself is a mathematician), it works in the same way as a virtual Wikipedia where the links between pages are represented physically in space.

It's a perfect example and model of a graph embedding.  A graph embedding is when you take a graph and assign every node to a point in space while minimizing the distance between points that are connected to each other while maximizing the distance between all other points.  It's a powerful method for representing graphs and enables a lot of really amazing things to be done with them.  One famous

One thing you might have noticed when reading this writeup is the insane degree of "meta" language about graphs that ends up being required to discuss them.  Bridges, "linked to", "related to", "about", "pattern", etc.; the verbiage is practically dripping with it.  It feels like approaching a limit when drawing a graph or watching some simulation converge - everything gets sucked in and wraps around some singular point of attraction.

I suppose that's near the heart of what I'm trying to convey with this.  The point isn't that there are nodes and edges underneath everything if you look closely enough, but rather that **graphs exist at the highest and lowest levels of representation and understanding of all things**.  They give meaning to the axioms and atoms for describing all systems, and they allow for relating those systems to all other systems that do or can exist.

### Cooling Down

One note I have to make before finishing is that we as humans completely perceive of the world using brains filled with neurons bound into a space-filling graph.  Our thought processes themselves are intrinsically and fundamentally graph-like.  It's possible that because of this, our understand of all things is inescapably biased to be in terms of graphs, or that people (or maybe just me) miss some more fundamental or better system of understanding.

I don't have an answer for this myself, but I do know that it is difficult (impossible?) to have a understanding of at least some systems from inside of that system, as with [GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems).

In addition, I find that spending time thinking about these kinds of things is hard on the mind; I swear I can feel my neurons shorting out a bit sometimes.  While planning and writing this writeup itself, I found myself having some trouble sleeping, experiencing thought loops, and feeling generally worked up and out of sorts.

If you find yourself suffering from the same kind of afflictions, listening to some chill music and doing something physical like taking a walk usually helps for me!  Regardless of how broadly applicable these kinds of ideas are, there's definitely a part of the human experience that can't be analyzed or understood and needs to simply be experienced as it is.
