This writeup introduces what I'm calling **Bonsai Networks** - extremely sparse computational graphs produced by training and pruning RNNs.  They provide an interpretable view into the solutions learned by networks for simple logic problems, breaking out of the black box neural networks typically reside in.

I give an overview of the process I use to create these networks which includes several custom neural network components and a training pipeline implemented from scratch in Tinygrad. I also include some interactive visualizations of the generated graphs and reverse engineer some interesting solutions they learned for a variety of logic-based programs.

## Background

My original inspiration for this project came from a blog post called [Differentiable Finite State Machines](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/2022/diff-fsm/).  It lays out a strategy for directly learning state machines to model binary sequences.  The FSMs are learned using gradient descent in a similar way to how neural networks are trained, hence the "differentiable" part of the title.

<div class="good xpadding">The part that I found especially interesting was how the author (<a href="https://znah.net/" target="_blank">Alexander Mordvintsev</a>, the creator of DeepDream) managed to extract "hard" FSMs the "soft" weights learned during training.</div>

I have a big interest in ML interpretability, and I've done [some work](https://cprimozic.net/blog/reverse-engineering-a-small-neural-network/) on reverse engineering small neural networks in the past.  The prospect of taking the big blob of floating point numbers + matrix multiplication and turning it into something that can be reasoned about and manipulated was very exciting to me.

This got me thinking about how I could expand the ideas from that post into something that could handle slightly more involved problems.  At some point, I had the idea of trying to extend the ideas from the FSM post to full-fledged RNNs.  That got me started on the path that eventually led to this project and writeup.

## Bonsai Networks Overview

Here's the headline:

<div class="note xpadding">Bonsai networks are computational graphs where nodes are neurons and edges are weights</div>

Since RNNs (and all other neural networks) are different kinds of computational graphs, it's also true that:

<div class="note xpadding">Bonsai networks are just extremely sparse RNNs</div>

That sparsity is their first key feature.  Most bonsai networks I trained ended up pruning out >90% of their weights.  And once you get networks that sparse and convert them into graphs, some unique things become possible.

<div class="good xpadding">By analyzing the pruned graphs, it's possible to eliminate entire neurons/branches of the tree in a manner similar to dead code elimination in a compiler</div>

By doing that, the sparsity goes up even further and the most minimal graphs can be created.

At a high level, the whole process of growing them looks like this:

 * Train sparse RNNs on random examples generated by the target program
 * Convert the weights from those RNNs into a graph data structure
 * Apply the DCE-like pruning to the graphs
 * Analyze the resulting graph to understand the network's solution

There's a good bit of nuance that's required for each of these points, so let's dive into that now.

## Custom Neural Network Components

The design goals of the RNNs I trained for the bonsai networks are quite different from those of RNNs used for conventional purposes.  In order to get good results with creating these bonsai networks, I needed to design some custom components and architectures for their training.

### Activation Function

The usual activation functions used when training neural networks - functions like sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, etc. - are usually quite simple.  For large, deep networks like the vast majority of those trained today, they're a great choice.  Neural networks are great at composing complex solutions out of these simple functions, building up more and more sophisticated internal representations over dozens of layers.

There's no rule saying that the activation function has to be simple, though.  Technically, any differentiable non-linear function will work.  For my purposes here, I wanted to pack as much computational power into the function as possible without making it impossible to train or numerically unstable.

I ended up using a custom activation function which looks like this:

<iframe src="https://nn-logic-demos.ameo.dev/activationPlot.html?interpolatedAmeo=1" class="iframe-mobile-scale" loading="lazy" style="display: block; outline: none; border: 1px solid rgb(136, 136, 136); box-sizing: border-box; width: 430px; overflow: hidden; height: 370px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></iframe>

I developed this activation function around a year ago as part of some [earlier research](https://cprimozic.net/blog/boolean-logic-with-neural-networks/#designing-a-new-activation-function) into using neural networks to perform boolean logic.  It has some unique properties which make it very well-suited for this particular use-case:

 * It can solve the *XOR problem* in a single neuron.  In fact, it can actually model [all 2 and 3 input boolean functions](https://cprimozic.net/blog/boolean-logic-with-neural-networks/#results) (like `a && b`, `!a && (b || !c)`, `a ? b : c`, etc.) in a single neuron as well.
 * It is well-balanced and has an average output value of 0 across all real numbers.
 * It has wide regions where it outputs very nearly -1 and 1.  This makes it less sensitive to quantization makes it easier to handle binary inputs and outputs.

All of these things contribute to making it very well-suited for modeling the kinds of binary logic programs I was targeting.  However, there are some downsides as well:

 * The complex, spiky derivative makes it more difficult to train using this function compared to conventional alternatives, and it is quite sensitive to initialization of network parameters.
 * The piecewise nature of its implementation makes it require a hand-written kernel and manually implemented derivative/backwards pass.

These certainly created some headaches to deal with, but they were well worth it for the power that this function unlocks for the networks.

### RNN Architecture

Another key modification I made was to the base architecture of the RNNs themselves.

I started out with a vanilla RNN modeled after TensorFlow's [`SimpleRNNCell`](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/v2.13.1/keras/layers/rnn/simple_rnn.py).  This is about as simple as it gets for a RNN, and I didn't use any of the fancy features like dropout, LSTM/GRU cells, etc.

Here's the architecture that TensorFlow uses for it:

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
<a target="_blank" href="https://i.ameo.link/bax.svg">
<img src="https://i.ameo.link/bax.svg" alt="TikZ-generated visualization of vanilla RNN architecture.  Shows two RNN cells labeled Cell 0 and Cell 1 which are wired together.  Internally, there are nodes for things like kernels and biases, operations like dot product, add, sigmoid, and nodes between them indicating the flow of data through the network." style="filter: invert(0.9); width: 100%; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; max-width: calc(min(760px, 90vw)); max-height: 840px;">
</a>
</div>

Like all RNNs, each cell has its own internal state which is fed back for the next timestep of the sequence.  In this vanilla architecture, the value passed on as output from the cell is the same as new state.

One important thing to note is how the inputs and current state are combined by adding them together before being passed to the activation function.

<div class="bad xpadding">I believe this is done to help with the vanishing/exploding gradient problem when training RNNs, but for my purposes it has the effect of glomming up the signals and making the dataflow harder to reason about.</div>

To solve this, I implemented a custom RNN cell using a modified architecture:

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
<a target="_blank" href="https://i.ameo.link/bb2.svg">
<img src="https://i.ameo.link/bb2.svg" alt="TikZ-generated visualization of the custom RNN architecture I developed for this project.  Shows a single cell of the custom RNN.  Internally, there are nodes for things like kernels and biases, operations like dot product, add, custom activation function A, and nodes between them indicating the flow of data through the network." style="filter: invert(0.9); width: 100%; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; max-width: calc(min(600px, 90vw)); max-height: 840px;">
</a>
</div>

It's pretty similar to the vanilla architecture but with a few key differences.

<div class="good xpadding">The main thing to note is that the output passed on to the next cell in the chain can be different from the new state fed back for the next timestep.</div>

This is important for multiple reasons:

 1. It decouples the state from the output.  Distinct representations can be learned for each that can be more concise, aiding in the production of very small and interpretable networks.
 2. The introduction of the second bias vector is useful for the custom activation function which requires rather specific combinations of weights and bias to represent some logic gates and other functions.
 3. It homogenizes the operations used by the network.  Rather than having to add different nodes for the neurons and then the `+` operator that combines the outputs from both dot products, the only used operation is `sum weighted inputs -> add bias -> activation`.

This last point is important for keeping the converted graphs at the end of the process as simple to understand as possible.  Every node can be thought of as a single neuron implementing this identical `sum weighted inputs -> add bias -> activation` operation, making the flow of data and overall operation much easier to follow.

### Sparsity-Promoting Regularizer

One of the most important goals when training the RNNs is ensuring that they are maximally sparse - meaning that as many of their weights are almost exactly zero as possible.  A commonly used technique for encouraging sparsity is the use of **regularizers** during the training process.

Regularizers can be thought of as secondary training objectives.  They are functions that take a tensor (weights, biases, or any other trainable parameter) and return a cost value.  That regularization cost is then added on to the base loss value computed for the current batch:

$$
Cost = Loss_{base}(y_{actual}, y_{pred}) + \lambda * R(\mathbf{w})
$$

where $R(\mathbf{w})$ represents the regularization function and $\lambda$ is the regularization coefficient which controls the intensity of the regularization.

<div class="note xpadding">For many different kinds of neural networks, decent success can be had by just <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/regularization-for-sparsity/l1-regularization">using <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext>L</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{L}_{1}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8333em; vertical-align: -0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">L</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.3011em;"><span style="top: -2.55em; margin-right: 0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height: 2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> regularization</a>.</div>

$\text{L}_{1}$ regularization penalizes weights based on their absolute value - the bigger the weight, the bigger the penalty linearly.  For larger networks, this can have the result of driving weights to zero without any extra effort required.

However, for my case, I wasn't getting much luck.  My best guess for why not is the behavior of the custom activation function.  To represent many logic gates concisely, the activation function needs to use rather large weights.  For my purposes, I didn't want to penalize a weight of 1.5 any more than a weight of 0.1, but $\text{L}_{1}$ regularization has the effect of penalizing the first way more.

<div class="bad xpadding">This made it very difficult for those configurations that required large weights to develop in the networks.  As a result, networks would use more resources to represent the same functionality in a less efficient manner.</div>

To fix this, I ended up implementing a custom regularization function.  It works by penalizing non-zero weights in the same way as $\text{L}_{1}$ regularization, but it has a sharp cutoff very close to zero at which point it "turns on" and starts penalizing the weight.  Crucially, the penalty goes up extremely gradually as weights get larger so the optimizer has more breathing room to tune existing weights to good values.

Here's the function I came up with:

Let:

$$
\begin{align*}
x & : \text{The tensor being regularized} \\
n & : \text{The number of elements in $x$} \\
t & : \text{The threshold for the regularization} \\
s & : \text{The steepness of the activation} \\
i_T & : \text{The intensity of custom function $T(x)$} \\
i_{L1} & : \text{The intensity of the l1 regularization} \\
\end{align*}
$$

The regularizer $R(x)$ consists of the custom function I developed $T(x)$ combined with standard l1 normalization:

$$
\begin{align*}
T(x) &= \tanh((|x| - t) \cdot s) - \tanh(-t \cdot s) \\
R(x) &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \left(i_T \cdot T(x_{j}) + i_{L1} \cdot |x_{j}|\right)
\end{align*}
$$

Or, if you like prefer code, here that is:

```py
class SparseRegularizer:
    def __init__(self, intensity=0.1, threshold=0.1, steepness=100, l1=0.001):
        self.intensity = intensity
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.steepness = steepness
        self.y_shift = np.tanh(-self.threshold * self.steepness)
        self.l1_intensity = l1

    def __call__(self, x: Tensor):
        abs_weights = x.abs()
        shifted_weights = abs_weights - self.threshold
        tanh_weights = (shifted_weights * self.steepness).tanh() - self.y_shift

        l1_weight = abs_weights.mean() * self.l1_intensity

        return tanh_weights.mean() * self.intensity + l1_weight
```

Note that it includes a very small amount of vanilla $\text{L}_{1}$ regularization.  I found that this is important to provide a gradient to drive unnecessary weights to zero since the gradient provided by the squooshed `tanh` is so miniscule on its own.

This plot shows the penalty added by the regularizer for different weight values:

<iframe src="http://localhost:3040/sparseRegularizerPlot" loading="lazy" style="display: block; outline: none; border: 1px solid rgb(136, 136, 136); box-sizing: border-box; width: 99%; height: 400px; max-width: 800px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow: hidden; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></iframe>

As you can see, the penalty for non-zero weights is essentially the same, so the network can actually optimize for true sparsity rather than just having a bunch of small weights.  However, the small gradient still exists to drive things in the right direction.

### Trainable Initial States

For the first timestep of a sequence, RNNs need to initialize their states to some value.  This is often done by just setting all hidden states to 0.

Zeroing initial states turns out to be quite limiting when training small networks.  In addition to being able to model state transitions from one timestep to another, the model also needs to learn how to initialize its state from scratch on the first timestep and differentiate between the first timestep and all others.

To look at it from a programming perspective, it's like forcing you to use `.reduce()` without being able to provide an initial state:

```ts
const { y } = [1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, x) => {
  if (!acc) {
    acc = { y: 4 };
  }

  acc.y = (acc.y + x) % 5;
  return acc;
}, null)
```

In the context of neural networks, that `if (!acc) { acc = { y: 4 }; }` operation could be very expensive, requiring several neurons and dozens of edges to implement.  This issue is made even more prominent due to the way the custom activation function works.  Since it's optimized to output -1 and 1, it makes it even harder to deal with the all-0 initial states in an elegant manner.

To solve this, I marked the initial state tensors themselves as trainable and initialize them to random values at the start of training.  It turns out that gradient descent has no problem at all optimizing those initial state values just like any other parameter in the network.

I found that this has a significant positive impact on the quality of graphs produced at the end, making them both smaller and easier to understand.  And since these initial state tensors are just constants, they don't add any actual complexity to the graphs created at the end.  The data flow itself can be simplified due to the greater degree of freedom the trainable initial states provide.

### Tinygrad

I implemented all of the custom components as well as the training pipeline itself in a framework called [Tinygrad](https://tinygrad.org/).

Tinygrad is an extremely minimal library which re-implements a modern ML toolkit with GPU-backed tensors, automatic differentiation, optimizers, and more from scratch.  It's under very active development and has gotten a lot of attention in recent months.

The main reasons I chose Tinygrad for this project are as follows:

<div class="good xpadding">Tinygrad has out-of-the box support for training on AMD GPUs.</div>

This is important for me since that's what I have available.  I was even able to write a OpenCL kernel for the custom activation function and its derivative, and it worked performantly on the first try.

<div class="good xpadding">It's the first library time I felt that I actually had an end-to-end view of the whole pipeline from high-level Tensor operations in Python to assembly code that runs on my GPU.</div>

For the same reasons I'm interested in AI interpretability, I have a keen interest in understanding how the code I write is compiled and executed.  Compared to the CPU with its rich ecosystem of debuggers, decompilers, and similar tools, the GPU has always felt like a foreign realm hidden behind mountains of abstraction to protect us developers from its terrible alienness.

Thanks to Tinygrad's truly tiny codebase and built-in debugging tools, I can easily print out the generated kernel OpenCL source code or even the raw disassembly for every operation in my network and training pipeline:

![A screenshot of some colorized CUDA disassembly generated by Tinygrad](./images/bonsai-networks/tinygrad-disassembly.png)

It makes the GPU feel like something I can interact with directly and understand natively rather than some opaque "accelerator" that gets magically invoked by "something" 300 layers deep in my call graph.

## Training

<div class="bad xpadding">All in all, training these bonsai networks really was quite difficult.</div>

To start, I implemented the function I wanted the network to learn in Python so I could generate infinite training data.  I then implemented a basic training loop in Tinygrad to form it into batches and use it to train the network.

It wasn't hard to get RNNs that successfully modeled the target function, but they weren't nearly sparse enough to be interpretable.  I spent many hours tweaking hyperparameters, layer counts and sizes, training data, and every other thing I could think of in an attempt to get nice, small graphs as output.

Even though all the custom stuff I described earlier helped a ton, the best I could get were graphs that looked like this:

![A screenshot of a computational graph pruned from a RNN.  There are many nodes and tons of overlapping edges giving it a very complex and impossible to follow structure.](./images/bonsai-networks/messy-graph.png)

It was _close_ to being interpretable, but still too messy to really make sense of things.

### Grokking

Since the networks I was training were quite small, the loss would bottom out quite quickly - usually after ~10-15 minutes of training or less.  At that point, the network would usually have perfect validation accuracy on the target function and I'd stop training and convert + prune the graph.

The breakthrough came when I left a training run going while I left my apartment for a few hours:

<div class="good xpadding">It turns out that if you just let the network keep training well after it has perfectly solved the problem, the regularization loss keeps going down very slowly and the network continues to sparsify itself further and further while still perfectly modeling the target function.</div>

The loss plot over the training run looked like this:

<iframe src="http://localhost:3040/grokkingLossDemo" loading="lazy" style="display: block; outline: none; border: 1px solid rgb(136, 136, 136); box-sizing: border-box; width: 99%; height: 436px; max-width: 800px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow: hidden; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></iframe>

The regularization loss sit at a plateau for thousands of batches and then spontaneously improve, all while the base loss is at almost exactly zero.  The regularization loss drops in satisfying, discrete chunks due to the way the custom sparsity-promoting regularizer works as described before.

<div class="note xpadding">When I observed this, I was immediately reminded of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N6WM6hs7RQMKDhYjB/a-mechanistic-interpretability-analysis-of-grokking">Grokking</a></div>

Grokking is a phenomenon that is observed when training neural networks where networks will sit at a local loss minima for a significant amount of time and then switch from memorizing data to implementing a general, more efficient solution.  The hallmark of grokking is a "phase transition" where the model will quite suddenly improve loss on the test set while the training loss remains low.

Although this situation is a bit different, something very similar was going on.  After more experimentation, I determined a set of conditions that were required for that behavior to show up for me:

1. The use of the Adam optimizer
2. Small-ish batch sizes
3. Use of the sparsity-promoting regularizer

These are quite similar to the set of conditions [found in the LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N6WM6hs7RQMKDhYjB/a-mechanistic-interpretability-analysis-of-grokking#Grokking___Phase_Changes___Regularisation___Limited_Data).

I'm not sure exactly what's going on internally to cause this behavior.  It's possible that this isn't "true" grokking and there's some other reason that this is happening, but in any case it was vital unlocking the ability to finally train really sparse networks.

## Constructing the Graphs

TODO

### Pruning

Once constructed, pruning the sparsified graphs is quite simple.

Starting from the outputs, a depth-first search is performed on the graph and the ID of every visited neuron is recorded.  Then, I go through every layer and just delete every neuron that wasn't visited.

### Visualization

To visualize the resulting graphs, my natural choice was Graphviz.  Graphviz is an incredibly versatile tool and has support for just about every customization and feature you might need for laying out and rendering graphs of all kinds.

I found a module called [`graphviz-builder`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphviz-builder) which allows Graphviz .dot format text to be generated programmatically.  Using that, it was fairly straightforward to generate a layout for the computation graphs.

The nodes are either neurons (square `N`) or states (circle `S`).  The edges are non-pruned weights.

The square neurons perform the `sum weighted inputs -> add bias -> activation` operation from before and so contain an internal bias.

The state neurons represent the feedback of state from one timestep to the next.  They have a max of one input edge which comes from the recurrent neuron they're paired with.  Their current value is passed to all output edges for the current timestep, and their value is replaced with the output of their paired recurrent neuron for the next timestep.

From there, I built a custom renderer using D3 in the browser that renders the graphviz layout and adds some interactivity to simulate different inputs and track the flow of data and state through the network over time.  Nodes and edges are colored to indicate the value they're _outputting_ at the current timestep.  So an edge with a weight of `-1` getting an input of `-1` will get a color of red since it outputs a value of `1`.

## Results

Now for the fun part!

I tried learning several different functions, gradually upping the complexity

### `y[n] = x[n-2]`

Let's start out with an extremely basic example: A network with a single layer trained to output the input from 2 timesteps ago, and output -1 otherwise:

$$
y_n =
\begin{cases}
x_{n-2} & \text{if } n \geq 2 \\
-1 & \text{if } n < 2
\end{cases}
$$

Here's the graph that was learned for that:

TODO

### `[-1, -1, 1]` loop

$$
y_n =
\begin{cases}
-1 & \text{if } n \mod 3 = 0,1 \\
1 & \text{if } n \mod 3 = 2
\end{cases}
$$

I was expecting the resulting graph to have a circle with three recurrent neurons in it, each one passing its current state on to the next directly without changing it, and initial states set to `[-1, -1, 1]`.

It turns out that the network was able to do better:

<iframe src="http://localhost:3040/threeStateLoopDemo" loading="lazy" style="display: block; outline: none; border: 1px solid rgb(136, 136, 136); box-sizing: border-box; width: 99%; height: calc(min(740px, 90vw)); margin-bottom: 10px;"></iframe>

Only two recurrent neurons are needed!

I dug into its solution and determined that it's equivalent to this logic:

```py
S0[0] = T
S1[0] = F

S0[n] = XNOR(S0[n-1], s1[n-1])
S1[n] = NOT(S0[n-1])
out   = S1[n]
```

Or written imperatively:

```py
S0 = True
S1 = False

for _ in range(12):
  S0, S1, out = S0 == S1, not S0, S1
  print(out)
```

That makes it clear that the 3-state FSM is representable using two bits of state.  Both of the logic gates used for the transitions are expressible in a single neuron each as well which is necessary to make it work.

### Balanced Parenthesis

Similar to the classic programming exercise, here the RNN is trained to interpret the input sequence as an expression like `()(()())` and, at each timestep, determine if the sequence is balanced.  I only produce valid sequences (no `())))` or similar) and cap the maximum nesting depth.

This is an example of something that FSMs have a hard time representing.

That example input sequence and the expected outputs are encoded like:

```txt
seq:       (  )   (   (   )   (   )  )

inputs:  [-1, 1, -1, -1,  1, -1,  1, 1]
outputs: [-1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1]
```

## Conclusion
