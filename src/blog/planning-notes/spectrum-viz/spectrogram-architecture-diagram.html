      alt="This diagram illustrates the
    signal analyzer module's workflow in a web-based digital audio workstation.
    The workflow is divided into two major threads: the Main Thread and the Web
    Worker Thread. The Main Thread handles initialization, running a recursive
    driver loop for data collection and rendering, building an OffscreenCanvas,
    and handling various events. The Web Worker Thread, on the other hand, is
    responsible for rendering the data received from the Main Thread and
    managing the state of the visualization. The two threads communicate through
    signals and message passing, ensuring smooth interaction between UI events,
    data collection, and rendering."
