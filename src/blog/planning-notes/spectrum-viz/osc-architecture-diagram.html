      alt="This diagram shows the workflow of a web-based oscilloscope within a digital audio workstation, divided into three major threads: Main Thread, Audio Thread, and Web Worker Thread. Each thread is represented as a subgraph with smaller task nodes inside. The Main Thread has nodes for initialization tasks and UI interactions. The Audio Thread depicts the AudioWorkletProcessor operations, and the Web Worker Thread displays the processing, rendering, and message handling tasks. Edges in the diagram represent data or control flow between these tasks and threads."
